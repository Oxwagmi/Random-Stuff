## Run

```bash
gcc  myFirstC.c  -o  myFirstC -lm
./myFirstC

```

### OutPut
```bash
Enter the value of x:69
Dy/Dx of sin(x) at x = 69.00 is 99339037972227161442569042804075463005036525826741750294979977150464.00
Dy/Dx of sin(x) at x = 69.00 is 0.99
Value of cos(x) at x = 69.00 is 0.99
Proof correct
```
